* Trivial-api
This is a trivial api that exists only to be deployed and have an action.
It's the test project part of finally getting around to bootstrapping all my new infra to be 100% nix based
and on Talos on Hetzner.
There's a pipeline that runs _quite fast_, it builds images and deploys them. The api can found at
http://api.fyfaen.as/trivial where it serves up a GET that gives you the string "hello".

Theres is a little management dashboard at https://nix.fyfaen.as that shows all the builds that are currently
available.

The workings are as follows:
- There is a webhook that creates a Build Crd.
- The build crd is handled by a controller that spawns jobs that do the actual build.
- The jobs report back over Nats and once they are completed they upload an image and send a manifest to the deploye
- The deploy job throws yaml at the cluster and messages at the controller with the status
